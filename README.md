## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
All Jupyter notebook files in this repository were created from the Google Colaboratory (https://colab.google/) environment.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
Deep learning models are useful to tackle chemistry problems as well as many other applications (e.g., image classification).  
This repository was created to practice PyTorch and its use for various neural network models.  
Both chemistry and non-chemistry projects are included in this repository.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
Each notebook file investigates different topics or projects ranging from basic operations of PyTorch to solving chemistry problems with deep learning.


## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
All study and project files in this repository are based on the lecture series by Prof. Lee, Juyong (https://sites.google.com/view/lcbc) of Seoul National University whom I should acknowledge. The lecture videos are publicly available on his YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30UV7ug7LwJQ_OwTKuQRvYPYIufFLafK).
