## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
All Jupyter notebook files in this repository were created from the Google Colaboratory (https://colab.google/) environment.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
Deep learning models are useful for tackling many applications (e.g., image classification) including chemistry problems. This repository was created to practice PyTorch and its use for various neural network models. The basics of PyTorch and two chemistry projects are included in this repository.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
Each notebook file investigates different topics or projects ranging from basic operations of PyTorch to solving chemistry problems with deep learning.  
The repository includes three folders below.  
- **PyTorch_Basics**: The basic operation of PyTorch and projects such as MNIST and CIFAR-10
- **Project1_Max_Absorption**: Predicted absorption maximum wavelength of organic compounds by developing multilayer perceptron models with thousands of actual experimental data from [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00634-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00634-8).
- **Project2_HOMO_LUMO_Gap**: Developed graph neural network (GNN) models using molecular graph and atom features for prediction of the HOMO-LUMO gap for 10,000 organic molecules obtained from the DFT calculation database (reference: [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00740](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00740)).
